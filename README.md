# Restaruant-Gift-Card-Lookup-App
This is the final project application I made for my advance java programming class.

In this repository you will find a Test Summary report (.doc), a folder with my developed integrated test scripts that work on Marathon ITE, also a folder with final executable files for both Windows (in .jar and in .exe) as well as MacOS (as .app). I also included my program converted to a web app run from a local Apache Tomcat server (built in .jnlp).

This app was made to create a way for users to locate local restaurants in the area from their location, display it on a Google Map, get directions from their location to a restaurant of their choice, as well as a process to to purchase gift cards from that venue.

This application leverages the Google API, JavaFX for GUI Design, and the following data structures for performance; Indexed List, Heap, Graph, and a few others.
